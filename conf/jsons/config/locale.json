    "game_description": "<div>Auto Roulette is a simple and exciting Casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. The rules of Auto Roulette are quite straightforward and identical to regular Roulette. In this game, you have a wheel that features red and black slots that have the numbers from 1 to 36 on them, and one or two green zero slots - depending whether you're playing European single zero roulette or American double zero roulette.</div><div>Except for the wheel, you have a table which also features the numbers and several additional sectors on which you can place bets: a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19-36) or low (1-18).</div><div>After all the participants in the game have placed their bets, the machine spins the wheel and the ball. Whichever is the number of the slot the ball lands in is the winning number and color.</div>"
  },
  "game_rules": {
    "game_rules_text": "<div><h2>Objective</h2><p>Forty nine balls numbered one to 49 are randomly mixed by the lottery machine Tombola. Six of the balls will be drawn one at a time displaying the winning numbers. The aim of the game is to predict the numbers or sums of the balls selected.</p><h2>Bet Types</h2><p>We offer 3 types of bets: betting on numbers, colors and sums. Each of these betting types includes 12 options for different bets, displayed as lines beneath each category name.</p> <p>Each bet type has a different payout rate (potential winning) that is specified at the end of the line with the bet name.</p><h2>Betting Instructions</h2><p>For your convenience, the lines are divided into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Betting on numbers</li><li>Betting on colors</li><li>Betting on sums</li></ul> <p>In each group we provide several lines to select from. In order to place a bet just click on the betting line and select an amount for the bet, then press the 'Place a Bet' button. This bet is applied for one round. When betting on numbers, select a number before placing the bet. To unselect a number, click again on the same number and choose another number.</p> <p>The player can purchase up to 20 tickets for 1 Draw. For each ticket the player selects the bet amount and desired betting option (line). Afterwards the player needs to click on the 'Place a Bet' button in order to add this ticket to the Current Draw. All the tickets added will be shown in the 'My Tickets' window located on the right side of the screen. Once the timer ends, the Draw will start and all the Tickets added will participate in this Draw.</p> <p>As long as the timer didn't end, the player can edit an added ticket or remove it from participating in the Draw. In order to do it, he needs to hover on the 'menu' icon located on the top right corner of a ticket and choose the options 'Edit' or 'Remove' from the Ticket's menu that will be open.</p><h2>Favorite Bets</h2><p>Each ticket or Slip (i.e. all tickets participating in a Draw) can be added to 'My Favorite Bets' for quick betting the chosen bet amount and numbers next time. In order to do it, the player needs to hover on the 'menu' icon located on the top right corner of a ticket and choose the option 'Add to Favorites' or click the Star icon located on the top left corner of a ticket or of a Draw Panel.</p> <p>In order to see the Favorite Bets and add them to a Draw, the player needs to click the button with a Star icon located on the right side of the 'Place a Bet' button.</p><h2>Error Handling</h2><p>If there is any error in the game procedure, the game round will be temporarily paused and the shift manager will be notified. Players will be notified by an on-screen pop-up message, to notify the player that the issue is in the process of investigation.If the manager can immediately resolve the error, the game round will continue as normal. If immediate resolution is not possible, the game round will be cancelled and initial bets will be refunded to all players who participated in the game round.</p><h2>Disconnection</h2><p>The Ezugi Live Dealer services are provided via internet, which inevitably may disconnect at times. This poses potential snags to the game flow and user experience.</p> <p>In order to minimize the impact caused by unexpected disconnections, when a player loses his connectivity to the game server, a reconnect message will be displayed on the screen.</p> <p>Until the player reconnects to the game server, the game and chat functionality will behave improperly or be completely inactive.</p> <p>The following error handling rules apply:</p><ul><li>In the event that a disconnection occurs before bets are placed, i.e. before the 'No More Bets' message on the screen, the bet will not be deducted from the balance and the player will not participate in the game round. Once reconnected, please verify your balance and inform your operator immediately if there are any issues.</li><li>In the event that a disconnection occurs after a game round begins, i.e. after the 'No More Bets' message on the screen, we do not guarantee that your bet was placed. Please verify with your operator to assure the balance is correct.If the bet was placed, the game will proceed as normal and the winnings will be processed according to the game result regardless of the disconnection. Please note the following exceptions:<ul><li>If playing on multiple seats games, there is a possibility that only some bets process while others don't.</li><li>A disconnection message might not be displayed to the player, and all decisions will proceed as the default decision.</li><li>In the event that a client disconnection occurred while playing the game, regardless of the status of the game, please make sure to review your balance after the reconnection and contact your operator if there is a problem.</li></ul></li></ul></div>"

Wheel Sectors and Neighbor bets can be played on by using a Roulette <b>Racetrack</b></p><p><b>Wheel Sectors</b> are the first and most important group of bets that the majority of players use. These types of bets are placed by using Roulette <b>Racetrack</b>.</p><p>A Single Zero Roulette wheel is split into 4 main sections that correspond to areas on the table. The traditional namesof these sections are in French - <b>Voisins du Zero</b> with a subsection <b>Jeu 0</b>, the <b>Tiers Du Cylindre</b> section, and <b>Orphelins</b>.</p><ul><li><b>Voisins du Zero</b> is a 9-chip bet that covers Zero plus seven numbers on the right and nine numbers on left. This is the        biggest sector on the wheel. It consists of 2 chips on Street 0/2/3, 2 chips on Corner 25/26/28/29 and one chip on each of        Splits: 4/7, 12/15, 18/21, 19/22 and 32/35.</li>        <li><b>Jeu 0</b> is a 4-chip bet that includes one chip on 26 in Straight-Up and one chip on each of Splits: 0/3, 12/15 and 32/35.</li>        <li><b>Tiers du Cylindre</b> a 6-chips bet which covers the numbers on the wheel from thirty-three to twenty-seven inclusive. One-chip        will be placed on each of Splits: 5/8, 10/11, 13/16, 23/24, 27/30 and 33/36.</li>        <li><b>Orphelins</b> is a 5-chip bet covering two slices of the wheel outside of Tiers and Voisins.

By click/tap on the circular \"-\" or \"+\" button, you can adjust the amount of neighbors that will be placed automatically while betting on the particular number.<br></p><p><i>For example, \"0 number and two Neighbors\" is a 5-chip bet with 1 Straight-Up on 3, 26, 0, 32 and 15.</i></p><h4>Roulette Valid Spin Rule</h4><p>A winning number is valid only when the spin was deemed valid</p><p>A valid spin is defined thus: <b>the Roulette ball must be spun by the Dealer in the direction opposite to the rotation of the wheel and must complete at least four revolutions around the track of the wheel before dropping to constitute a valid spin.</b></p><p>If the spin is defined as not valid, this situation is called as “No Spin”.</p><p>Situations where a “No Spin” will be declared in the following cases:</p><ul><li>The ball made less than 4 complete revolutions;</li>        <li>The ball was spun in the same direction as the wheel;</li>        <li>The ball or wheel were spun in the wrong direction;</li>        <li>The wheel stopped rotating during the spin;</li>        <li>The ball drops, does not go into a pocket, but just revolves on the wheel for more than 3 wheel cylinder revolutions;</li>        <li>The ball came out of the wheel (ball-out);</li>        <li>Any foreign object enters the wheel.</li></ul><p>In case of a “No Spin”, the Dealer will re-spin the ball based on our procedures.</p><p>Your bet will remain on the table until a valid spin is made.</p><p></p><h4>Game inconveniences</h4><p>If there is any error in the game procedure, the game round will be temporarily paused and the shift manager will be notified. You will be notified by an on-screen pop-up message, to highlight that the issue is being investigated</p><p>If the manager can immediately resolve the error, the game round will continue as normal. If immediate resolution is not possible, the game round will be cancelled and initial bets will be refunded to all players who participated in the game round.</p><p>You personally are responsible for the correct positioning of your wager or wagers on Roulette table.<br></p><p>In case, your bet exceeds any min or max limit, it will be adjusted automatically and you will be informed about this with a notification on the screen.</p><p>In case, the ball is landed in the number slot but the different winning number appears on your screen, the correct winning number should be considered the one where the ball has landed in the Roulette wheel.</p><p>In case of any irregularities, please provide the Round number of the game in question to the Customer Support.</p><h4>Disconnection</h4><p>The Ezugi Live Dealer services are provided via internet, which inevitably may disconnect at times. This poses potential snags to the game flow and user experience.</p><p>In order to minimize the impact caused by unexpected disconnections, when a player loses his connectivity to the game server, a reconnect message will be displayed on the screen.</p><p>The following error handling rules apply in case of disconnection:</p><ul><li>In the event that a disconnection occurs before the 'No More Bets' message on the screen and your bets were not accepted        yet by the server, your bets will not be deducted from the balance and you will not participate in the game round. Once reconnected,        please verify your balance and inform your operator immediately if there are any issues.</li>  <li>In the event that a disconnection occurs after a game round begins, i.e. after the 'No More Bets' message on the screen and your bets were accepted by the server the game will proceed as normal and the winnings will be processed according to the game result regardless of the disconnection.</li></ul>"
